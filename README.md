Hash Lecture by Christopher Kim 

Christopher has led a small lecture session about "hashing" today. Having learned and self-studied hashing last year in data structure class w/ former teacher Mr. Kirkwood, he had gained sufficient & interesting information about it to the extent in which he believed he could help other members of our club to get familiar with this concept. Indeed, he was right! Throughout the meeting, he eloquently described general information, fundamental concepts, and real-life implementations regarding the topic. Chris and Tommy, members who were present at the meeting, were drawn into the sophisticated nature of hashing and asked many questions throughout the discussion. 

A digital copy of Christopher's worksheet can be found in this folder.
